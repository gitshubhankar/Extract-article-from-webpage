# Extract-article-from-webpage
In this project, we will extract an article content and its title without extracting unnecessary things (ads, links, etc.) 
We will do this by performing web scraping using python and extract the needed text using the necessary libraries and url to web page. In the example I have given, we have used Wikipedia page .
Check out code.py file for this repository for the code and its explanation.
